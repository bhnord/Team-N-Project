We ask patients and visitors to use our Mass General Brigham Prescreen app at prescreen.massgeneralbrigham.org before their arrival. The app is available in English and Spanish. It walks users through a series of questions to screen for symptoms of illness. Screening questions must be answered on the day of your appointment or visit. Learn how to use the app before your visit.&#10;&#10;After answering the screening questions, patients and visitors will receive a digital pass on their phone that provides faster entry to our facilities. Patients who may have completed a phone screening prior to their visit still need to answer questions on the prescreen app before entry.&#10;&#10;For patients and visitors who need help in other languages, staff are available to assist at our entrances.&#10;&#10;WHICH ENTRANCE DO I USE?&#10;Patients and visitors are asked to enter through the 75 Francis St. or 45 Francis St. entrances at this time. If you need directions to your destination within the hospital, use our Maps app to plan your route.&#10;&#10;Testing&#10;I THINK I MIGHT HAVE COVID-19, SHOULD I GET TESTED?&#10;Refer to our page about COVID-19 for risk factors, symptoms and other information.&#10;&#10;If you are an established Mass General Brigham patient with a primary care provider, we recommend you contact your provider’s office by phone or via Patient Gateway if you have symptoms that may indicate exposure to COVID-19 or if you believe you may have been exposed.&#10;&#10;If you are an established Mass General Brigham patient and do not have a primary care provider — or are unable to reach them — there are other resources available to you:&#10;&#10;Use the Mass General Brigham COVID-19 Screener. This always-on web tool allows Mass General Brigham patients who have symptoms of COVID-19 — or who are concerned about exposure to COVID-19 — to walk through a few automated online questions. At the end of the brief assessment, patients will be directed to next steps based on their health status.&#10;Call the Mass General Brigham COVID-19 Nurse Line at 617-724-7000. Staffed from 8am to 4:30pm 7 days a week, nurses are available to respond to general or specific questions about COVID-19 for those who have symptoms, believe they may have been exposed, or are looking to learn more. If treatment is needed, they will guide you through next steps. Interpreters can be added to calls for patients who need it.&#10;Launch a video visit with an urgent care provider at Mass General Brigham On Demand. Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Mass General Brigham On Demand is suggested for those who have symptoms of COVID-19 and/or have underlying conditions that may put them at greater risk. A doctor or advanced practitioner will conduct an intake assessment via a secure video visit and recommend next steps. Note that this service is only available to established Mass General Brigham patients in Massachusetts.&#10;Safety&#10;WHAT IS THE BRIGHAM DOING TO KEEP PATIENTS, THEIR FAMILIES AND STAFF SAFE?&#10;The health and safety of our patients, families and staff is our top priority. As we prepare to welcome more patients back to our hospital and outpatient facilities, we are taking a comprehensive approach to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. We know that COVID-19 will be with us for the foreseeable future, so we’ve implemented the following measures to provide the safest possible environment:&#10;&#10;Performing rigorous, around-the-clock cleaning for all areas, with additional emphasis on patient care areas&#10;Screening all patients, visitors and staff for respiratory illness at entrances&#10;Requiring all patients, visitors and staff to wear masks to help prevent spread of infection&#10;Enforcing physical distancing in our buildings and encouraging everyone to practice good hand hygiene&#10;Modifying schedules across the hospital and our outpatient facilities to limit the number of people onsite at one time&#10;Learn more about our Safe Care Commitment.&#10;&#10;IF YOU ARE LIMITING STAFF, WILL THERE BE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO PROVIDE SAFE CARE?&#10;The hospital is committed to ensuring that we have appropriate staff to care for every patient. The majority of staff who are working remotely are in administrative support roles.&#10;&#10;WHAT CLEANING TECHNIQUES ARE BEING USED TO PREVENT SPREAD OF INFECTION?&#10;Our specially trained and certified staff thoroughly cleans our facilities around the clock. This involves using methods recommended by the CDC for disinfecting patient care areas and all common areas, including hallways, waiting rooms, restrooms, elevators and dining areas.&#10;&#10;IS IT SAFE TO TAKE ELEVATOR RIDES WITH OTHER PEOPLE?&#10;Our Infection Control leaders have advised that being in close proximity to others for brief periods of time is acceptable when everyone is wearing masks. In our elevators, floor stickers indicate where occupants should stand to maintain at least two feet of spacing between all occupants.&#10;&#10;ARE WHEELCHAIRS BEING CLEANED BETWEEN USE?&#10;Yes, wheelchairs are always cleaned between patients.&#10;&#10;IS THERE A LACK OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) AT THE HOSPITAL?&#10;While there were shortages of some items of PPE throughout the pandemic, all of our care sites currently have adequate supply of all necessary PPE.&#10;&#10;SHOULD I WEAR A FACE MASK?&#10;In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting.&#10;&#10;Please note, effective Monday April 6, all patients and visitors in any clinical setting at Brigham and Women’s Hospital will be supplied with a procedural or surgical mask which must be worn as part of our continued efforts to protect our health care workers and patients.&#10;&#10;For more information about face masks, see “How To Protect Yourself” on the CDC’s FAQ webpage.&#10;&#10;HOW CAN I HELP KEEP THE BRIGHAM HEALTH COMMUNITY SAFE?&#10;We ask you to help us keep our community safe by:&#10;&#10;Calling us before you visit if you have symptoms of respiratory illness.&#10;Checking in for your appointment via phone or Patient Gateway.&#10;Always leaving 6 feet between yourself and others.&#10;Wearing a mask at all times during your visit.&#10;Practicing good hand hygiene.&#10;Alerting a Brigham staff member if you have any safety questions or concerns." />
